Playbooks are the basis for comfiguration management using Ansible, they are capable of deploying complex configurations and applications.

A playbook can consist of many plays. A play maps specified tasks to targetted hosts. Tasks run modules and are executed sequentially, i.e. in order from top to bottom and one task is completed before the next one is run.

## Working with Playbooks
Playbooks are written in YAML. YAML is an acronymn for "Yet Another Markup Language". It is NOT a programming language and tries to model configurations or processes with minimum syntax.
